Richard P. Feynman once said, "If you want to master something, teach it." This simple yet profound advice has been a guiding beacon in my adventure of leading a study group, where I impart knowledge and continually learn and refine my understanding of the subjects we tackle together. In this blog post, I'll share why I started a study group, the methods I've adopted, the rewards of teaching, and the lessons learned along the way. Whether you're a seasoned educator or a curious learner, I hope to offer insights into the transformative power of teaching and how it can deepen one's mastery of any subject.

## What is a study group?

A study group is a collective of individuals with a common goal of learning and enhancing their understanding of specific subjects. These groups provide a structured yet flexible environment where members can discuss, solve problems collaboratively, and share resources and insights. Unlike traditional classroom settings, study groups are often peer-led and can adapt to their members' specific needs and pace.

## Why I started leading a study group

Embarking on leading a study group was driven by personal aspirations and professional goals. Here's why I took the helm:

### 1. Learning through Teaching

As I mentioned in the introduction, “The best way to learn is to teach” resonates deeply with me. Software engineers need to study and learn things endlessly (as many IT professionals would agree) to survive in the industry, and I wanted to deepen my knowledge and learn new things. Teaching programming and web development topics seemed like an ideal strategy to solidify my understanding and discover new insights. This approach allowed me to reinforce my existing knowledge and challenged me to explore areas of my expertise with greater rigour.

### 2. Building Connections

Having moved to Sydney just a year ago, I was keen on expanding my network within the IT community. Leading a study group presented a perfect opportunity to meet like-minded individuals passionate about technology and continuous learning. It has been a gateway to making new friends and acquaintances, enriching my social and professional life in a new city.

### 3. The Joy of Teaching

There's an intrinsic satisfaction in sharing knowledge and seeing that lightbulb moment in someone else's eyes. Teaching has always been something I enjoy, and leading a study group allows me to indulge in this passion regularly. It's rewarding to see others grow and learn, knowing that I am contributing to their development.\
\
These reasons combined to form a compelling case for why I started leading a study group. It's not just about teaching; it's about creating a community of learners who support and inspire each other.

## How I Manage and Lead the Study Group Sessions

Leading a study group comes with unique challenges and responsibilities, especially when the members are aspiring professionals with limited practical knowledge despite their academic backgrounds. Here's how I organise and manage our learning sessions:

### Weekly Teaching Session

I conduct classes once a week, accommodating both in-person and online formats to ensure accessibility for all members. Given that most participants are relatively inexperienced in the specific IT roles they aspire to, I opt for a more structured lecture-style format. This approach helps lay foundational knowledge and ensures everyone is on the same page before moving into more complex topics.

#### Tools for Communication and Resource sharing:

- **Discord**: We use Discord for regular communication, scheduling, and real-time interaction during online sessions. This platform facilitates an easy exchange of ideas and spontaneous Q&A, making the learning process more interactive.
- **Zoom**: Whether I conduct a class online or offline, I record the class using Zoom for people who want to review or cannot join the session.
- **Notion**: All class materials, including slides, notes, and additional resources, are shared through Notion. After each class, I upload the day's content, the presentation slides, and a link to the Zoom recording. This ensures that members who could not attend the session or need to revisit the materials can access them conveniently.

### Mentoring Aspiring Web Devs

Beyond the general study sessions, I mentor individuals interested in becoming web developers. Recognising the extensive material to cover, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and React, I guide them through structured online courses I have vetted and found effective. Each week, I assign tasks such as completing specific chapters or preparing a presentation on what they've learned, which we discuss in our weekly Zoom meetings.

#### Practical Application and Collaboration:

- **Toy Projects**: After the basics are covered, I assign toy projects that challenge members to apply what they've learned in a practical, project-based context. This solidifies their understanding and enhances their problem-solving skills.
- **Version Control Training**: To prepare them for real-world software development practices, I teach them how to use Git and GitHub. This includes basic commits and branches to more advanced concepts like merges and pull requests.
- **Code Reviews**: I provide code reviews for their projects, offering constructive feedback and guidance on how to fix and refactor their code for better performance and readability.

## The Benefits of a Study Group

Leading a study group has been an enriching experience, not just for the members but also for me as a mentor. Here's a look at the advantages from both my perspective and that of the members:

### As a Mentor

#### 1. Deepening Knowledge

One of the principal benefits of teaching is enhancing one's understanding. To effectively teach, I must ensure the accuracy and depth of the information I provide, which compels me to research and thoroughly fill any gaps in my knowledge. This preparation process is an excellent way to reinforce and expand my expertise, particularly when explaining fundamental concepts to beginners. This practice aligns closely with the Feynman Technique, which emphasises that teaching is one of the best ways to learn it.

#### 2. Rewarding Experiences

The most gratifying aspect of leading a study group is witnessing the tangible progress of its members, not only in terms of their hard skills but also their mental and emotional growth. Its positive impact on their attitudes and professional outlook is deeply fulfilling. A testament to this was the heartening feedback I received on LinkedIn, where a member expressed how my "ambition and self-motivation" were inspiring and instrumental in their achievements. Such feedback motivates me to continually improve my mentoring skills and my development as a professional.

### As a member

#### 1. Sustained Motivation

For many, the structured environment of a study group provides the necessary push to maintain motivation, which can be challenging when studying alone, especially in fields like programming and IT. The element of peer pressure, while gentle, encourages consistency and helps prevent procrastination. Regular meetings and set tasks create a rhythm of accountability that drives members to stay on track with their learning goals.

#### 2. Access to Mentorship

Access to a mentor, especially for beginners, is an invaluable resource. In our study group, members benefit from guided learning at no cost, receiving personalised advice and feedback from someone with real-world experience. This mentorship helps them navigate the often complex content and boosts their confidence in applying the skills learned.

## Lessons Learned and Future Improvements

Through leading the study group, I've identified key areas where our system could be enhanced to foster better learning outcomes and group dynamics. Here are the main aspects I plan to refine:

### 1. Enforcing Accountability

One significant lesson I've learned is the importance of accountability in ensuring all members keep pace with the group. The lack of penalties for failing to complete assignments has led to inconsistent participation in homework tasks, which is crucial for reinforcing the material covered in our sessions. This inconsistency affects the individual's learning progress and widens the gap between more diligent members and those who might need to catch up. To address this, I am considering implementing a system that introduces mild consequences for missed deadlines, perhaps affecting participation privileges or access to additional resources. This system aims to motivate members to complete their assignments on time, ensuring everyone remains on equal footing and can actively participate in discussions without the need for repetitive reviews.

### 2. Refined Selection Process

Another area for improvement is the selection process for new study group members. The current open-door policy has been inclusive but also presents challenges when members have vastly different base knowledge and experience levels. For more advanced topics or projects, a baseline understanding is crucial for the smooth progression of the group. Therefore, I am contemplating introducing a selection mechanism that might include a basic skills test or a pre-joining questionnaire to assess potential members' foundational knowledge. This approach will help tailor the group's composition, ensuring that all members are at a similar starting point and can move forward at a comparable pace.

## Future Plans for the Study Group

As the leader of our study group, planning for both the immediate and long-term future is important to ensure that we continue to grow and adapt to the needs and aspirations of members. Here's a detailed outline of what I envision for the remainder of this year and beyond:

### Plans for the Rest of the Year

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: I aim to complete our sessions on Data Structures and Algorithms over the next two months. This foundational knowledge is essential for all aspiring software engineers and will prepare them well for technical interviews and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.
- **Front-End Development**: I plan to introduce TypeScript to the front-end team once we wrap up the React section. Its robust typing system offers more safety and efficiency in coding, which is crucial for team collaboration. Additionally, we will explore Next.js, a robust framework built on React, to enhance our capabilities in full-stack development.

### Plans for the next stage

#### Rotation Teaching System

I plan to implement a rotation system for teaching to foster a more interactive and engaging learning environment. Instead of leading every session, each member can present on a topic. This approach will encourage deeper engagement and preparation among all members, as each person will need to research and understand the material thoroughly to teach it effectively.

#### New Learning Areas

I'm excited to delve into areas such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and various DevOps practices.

#### Maybe a Book Club?

To supplement our practical sessions with theoretical knowledge, I'm considering a book club-like study group focused on software architecture and design patterns. This will provide a structured way to tackle these complex topics, allowing us to learn from leading experts through their published works.
